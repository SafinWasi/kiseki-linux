Falcom's Kiseki (Trails, Legend of Heroes, 軌跡)… for Linux!
============================================================

This repository unofficially hosts [Lutris-based **Linux** installers][lutris]
for *all* entries in [Falcom][falcom]'s acclaimed [*Kiseki* (i.e., *Trails*,
*Legend of Heroes*, 軌跡) universe][kiseki]: the longest-running continuously
interconnected Japanese role-playing (JRPG) series now spanning three decades
of active development.

This repository hosts installers with out-of-the-box support for popular
controllers, in-game cutscenes and videos, and full Japanese voice acting with
fully localized English and Simplified Chinese subtitles – including:

* High-quality voice acting converted by [Zhenjian Yang][zhenjian-yang]'s
  [third-party SoraVoice library][sora-voice] from the Japan-only "Evolution"
  Vita ports of the original *Sora no Kiseki* trilogy (i.e., *Sora no Kiseki
  FC*, *Sora no Kiseki SC*, *Sora no Kiseki the 3rd*).
* High-quality unofficial translations by the [third-party localization group
* GeoFront][geofront] for those entries still lacking official
  translations (i.e., *Zero no Kiseki*, *Ao no Kiseki*).

This repository is also a [central hub for discussing and resolving issues in
Linux emulation across all *Kiseki* entries][local-issues]. Help us get a
better idea of the state of these installers by **[submitting a new issue
documenting your installation and playthrough experience][local-issue-new].**

> ⚠️

> These installers are **not officially endorsed** by [Falcom][falcom], [Nippon
> Ichi Software (NIS)](nis), or [XSEED][xseed]. We still love you,
> [Toshihiro Kondo][toshihiro-kondo].
