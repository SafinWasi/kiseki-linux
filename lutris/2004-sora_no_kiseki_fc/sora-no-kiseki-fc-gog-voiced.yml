    # This version intentionally does *NOT* contain the magic substring "GOG",
    # as doing so magically enables non-ideal GOG integration in Lutris. Since
    # GOG users commonly prefer to manage GOG downloads themselves rather than
    # implicitly through Lutris, the current approach is typically preferable.
    # GOG users instead preferring Lutris to manage GOG downloads are
    # encouraged to add the following line to the "game:" section below:
    #     gogid: 1207665083
    # Note also that GOG integration was broken for nearly a year throughout
    # the Lutris 0.5.8.x lifecycle, which does *NOT* inspire confidence.

        #FIXME: Remove this *AFTER* Lutris implicitly supports multi-part GOG
        #installers again. Unfortunately, Lutris 0.5.8.x fundamentally broke
        #support for these installers by copying installer files into isolated
        #cache directories and then attempting to extract and/or run those
        #files from those directories. We currently circumvent this by
        #requiring users to manually select *ALL* parts of multi-part GOG
        #installers, which we then recombine back into a single cache directory
        #with absurd symlinking. While awful, this works. Since this is awful,
        #however, we would prefer to undo this as soon as Lutris fixes itself.
